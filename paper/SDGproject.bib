  abstract = {The sheer number of organizations adopting an innovation can cause a bandwagon pressure, prompting other organizations to adopt this innovation. Institutional bandwagon pressures occur because nonadopters fear appearing different from many adopters. Competitive bandwagon pressures occur because nonadopters fear below-average performance if many competitors profit from adopting. Our mathematical model of bandwagons examines how organizational collectivities' characteristics determine (a) whether a bandwagon will occur, (b) how many organizations jump on it, and (c) how many retain the Innovation it diffuses. Simulating the model suggests, first, that any technological, organizational, or strategic innovation with ambiguous returns can diffuse in a bandwagon manner; second, that minor differences in organizational collectivities can have major effects on bandwagons' occurrence, extent, and persistence: and third, that bandwagons can prompt most organizations in a collectivity to adopt an innovation, even when most of them expect that this adoption will yield negative returns. We suggest how to test our bandwagon model.},

  abstract = {Questions about norm diffusion in world politics are not simply about  whether and how ideas matter, but also which and whose ideas matter.  Constructivist scholarship on norms tends to focus on  ``hard'' cases of moral transformation in which  ``good'' global norms prevail over the ``bad''  local beliefs and practices. But many local beliefs are themselves part  of a legitimate normative order, which conditions the acceptance of  foreign norms. Going beyond an existential notion of congruence, this  article proposes a dynamic explanation of norm diffusion that describes  how local agents reconstruct foreign norms to ensure the norms fit with  the agents' cognitive priors and identities. Congruence building  thus becomes key to acceptance. Localization, not wholesale acceptance  or rejection, settles most cases of normative contestation. Comparing  the impact of two transnational norms on the Association of Southeast  Asian Nations (ASEAN), this article shows that the variation in the  norms' acceptance, indicated by the changes they produced in the  goals and institutional apparatuses of the regional group, could be  explained by the differential ability of local agents to reconstruct  the norms to ensure a better fit with prior local norms, and the  potential of the localized norm to enhance the appeal of some of their  prior beliefs and institutions.I thank  Peter Katzenstein, Jack Snyder, Chris Reus-Smit, Brian Job, Paul Evans,  Iain Johnston, David Capie, Helen Nesadurai, Jeffrey Checkel, Kwa Chong  Guan, Khong Yuen Foong, Anthony Milner, John Hobson, Etel Solingen,  Michael Barnett, Richard Price, Martha Finnemore, and Frank  Schimmelfennig for their comments on various earlier drafts of the  article.

  abstract = {An American epistemic community played a key role in creating the international shared understanding and practice of nuclear arms control. In the absence of nuclear war, leaders' expectations of nuclear war and of its control were affected by causal theories and abstract propositions and models which, given their ``scientific'' and technical nature, were developed by an epistemic community. This study, which emphasizes the roles played by epistemic communities in policy innovation and in the diffusion of understandings across nations and communities, analyzes how the theoretical and practical ideas of the arms control epistemic community became political expectations, were diffused to the Soviet Union, and were ultimately embodied in the 1972 antiballistic missile (ABM) arms control treaty. In contrast to those studies that have concentrated primarily on the workings of international epistemic communities, this study stresses the notion that domestically developed theoretical expectations, which were worked out by a national group of experts and selected by the American government as the basis for negotiations with the Soviets, became the seed of the ABM regime. Moreover, by suggesting that the arms control epistemic community was really an aggregation of several factions that shared common ground against various intellectual and policy rivals, this study sheds light on the question of how much coherence an epistemic community requires. The political selection of new conceptual understandings, followed by their retention and diffusion at national and international levels, suggests an evolutionary approach at odds with explanations of international change advanced by structural realism and approaches based on it.},

I test this hypothesis by examining the determinants of state adoption of the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Model Act, a comprehensive set of regulations developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). My central finding is that states whose insurance commissioner participated in the NAIC's Accident and Health Insurance Committee, which has jurisdiction over HMO regulation, were more likely than other states to adopt the Model Act. This result provides evidence that associations can affect policy diffusion. It also sharpens the conventional wisdom by highlighting a specific institutional arrangement\textemdash a committee system\textemdash through which participation in associations can facilitate the adoption of innovations.},

The theory assumes that governments' decisions constitute a strategic game in which governments are influenced by their neighbors. We suggest a variety of policy contexts in which the theory is applicable. For one such context\textemdash the adoption of lotteries by American states\textemdash we use the theory to generate several hypotheses and then test them using event history analysis. The results provide substantial support for the theory and indicate that states compete for lottery business in a much more sophisticated fashion than has been previously recognized.}

It finds that the literature has evolved from its rather narrow, state-centred roots to cover many more actors and venues. While policy transfer still represents a niche topic for some researchers, an increasing number have successfully assimilated it into wider debates on topics such as globalisation, Europeanisation and policy innovation. This article assesses the concept's position in the overall `tool-kit' of policy analysis, examines some possible future directions and reflects on their associated risks and opportunities.},

The most common empirical approach for studying interstate influence is modeling an indicator of a state's policy choice as a function of its neighbors' policies, with each neighbor weighted equally. This can appropriately specify one form of learning model, but it does not adequately test for interstate competition: when a policy diffuses due to competition, states' responses to other states vary depending on the size and location of specific populations. We illustrate with two substantive applications how geographic information systems (GIS) can be used to test for interstate competition. We find that lottery adoptions diffuse due to competition\textemdash rather than to learning\textemdash but find no evidence of competition in state choices about welfare benefits. Our empirical approach can also be applied to competition among nations and local jurisdictions.},

We show that the two are conceptually compatible, relying on Mohr's theory of organizational innovation. Then we develop and test a unified explanation of state lottery adoptions reflecting both internal and regional influences. The empirical results provide a great degree of support for Mohr's theory.

While little support is found for the economic development and party control explanations, our empirical results are highly consistent with a political opportunity explanation of state tax adoptions; (1) the presence of a long time until the next election, (2) the existence of a fiscal crisis, and (3) the presence of neighboring states that have previously adopted a tax all create opportunities for politicians to shield themselves from the political costs of supporting a tax increase and are all shown by empirical analysis to increase the probability of a tax adoption. This empirical evidence is consistent across different tax instruments and different periods of analysis throughout the twentieth century.}

  abstract = {When modeling regional policy diffusion effects, scholars have traditionally made appeals to both social learning and economic competition as causes of diffusion. In their empirical studies of policy adoption, however, they do not attempt to determine which of these two processes are at work. In this article, we argue that these two types of diffusion may have different implications for when a state first adopts a policy and subsequent changes in the extent of that policy and that these effects vary by policy area. In the specific policy area that we study, Indian gaming, we expect social learning diffusion to influence adoption but not expansion; economic competition should influence both policy adoption and policy expansion. Our empirical results confirm these predictions. To study both policy adoption and innovation, we apply models for event counts to state policy data, which allows us to model the extent of policy adoption over time, rather than just the timing of first adoption as is common with event history models.},

They also confirm that countries tend to follow the direction in which the majority of other countries in the world are moving. Their model builds on several findings in the diffusion literature but adds methodological improvements and includes more extensive controls for other variables that have been found to affect regime change\textemdash including levels of development, presidentialism, and regional differences\textemdash offering further support for some and challenging other findings of the regime change literature.},

  abstract = {In the last two decades, striking correlations in the location and timing of structural pension reforms have raised important questions about the kind of information used by policy makers in their decisions to adopt such measures. This study tests the hypothesis that the adoption of pension privatization is shaped systematically by an interdependent logic, wherein the decision to privatize pensions in one country is systematically linked to corresponding decisions made by governments in relevant peer nations. Duration analysis with time-varying covariates of data from 59 countries between 1980 and 1999 reveals that the decision to adopt a private pension reform in one country increases systematically as the proportion of peer nations that have adopted corresponding measures rises. Importantly, the effect of this peer dynamic varies across groups of nations, with the most powerful impact of peer decisions being found among Eastern European and Central Asian nations. Peer dynamics likewise contribute powerfully to the adoption of private pension reforms in Latin America, but do not significantly shape the hazard of privatization among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member nations. Even controlling for diffusion mechanisms, the analysis shows that pension reform decisions remain subject to domestic political and economic considerations, including demographic pressures, financial costs and incentives to reform, and constraints delimited by the political institutions in each nation.},

The empirical findings indicate that the competition mechanism induced by network position similarity in the network of portfolio investment and that of exports causes policy diffusion in corporate taxation; the socialization mechanism (policy learning and emulation) induced by network position proximity in the IGO networks also drives policy changes, and the evidence is much stronger in the IGO networks that facilitate policy learning than in those that facilitate emulation. The paper also discusses explicitly empirical challenges to incorporate network characteristics into connectivity matrices in spatial lag models often used to study policy diffusion. It suggests that students of policy diffusion should discuss as explicitly as possible the assumptions and procedures to construct connectivity matrices and present results from alternative specifications: our conclusion on the strength of policy diffusion is often sensitive to the choice of connectivity matrices.},

  abstract = {International institutions are a ubiquitous feature of daily life in  many world regions, and nowhere more so than contemporary Europe. While  virtually all would agree that such institutions matter, there is less  agreement on exactly how they have effects. This special issue brings  together European Union specialists and international relations theorists  who address the latter issue. In particular, we explore the socializing  role of institutions in Europe, with our central concern being to better  specify the mechanisms of socialization and the conditions under which  they are expected to lead to the internalization of new roles or  interests. Drawing on a multifaceted understanding of human rationality,  we consider three generic social mechanisms\textemdash strategic calculation,  role playing, and normative suasion\textemdash and their ability to promote  socialization outcomes within international institutions. This  disaggregation exercise not only helps consolidate nascent socialization  research programs in international relations theory and EU studies; it  also highlights points of contact and potential synergies between  rationalism and social constructivism.For  comments on earlier versions, I am grateful to two anonymous referees,  IO editors Lisa Martin and Thomas Risse, as well as to John  Duffield, Alexandra Gheciu, Liesbet Hooghe, Peter Katzenstein, Ron  Mitchell, Frank Schimmelfennig, Martha Snodgrass, and Michael Z\"urn.

However, the extant literature has mostly adopted a sole-goal perspective and neglected the influences of the interplay among multiple goals. This article extends the literature by going beyond the sole-goal perspective and adopting a multigoal perspective to further explore the complexities in public organizations' goal prioritization when facing multiple conflicting goals. Drawing on the theoretical perspectives of performance information use and interorganizational interactions, the main arguments of this study are twofold. First, an organization's prioritization of a particular goal will be positively associated with the performance gap in its conflicting goal. Second, organizations tend to adopt a differentiation strategy in the prioritization of multiple conflicting goals. Empirical findings based on the investigation of Chinese city-level governments' prioritization of environmental goals when confronting conflict between environmental protection and economic development goals support our arguments.},

  abstract = {During the 1980s the Thatcher Government implemented numerous changes to the British employment system. Most of these changes had the effect of linking the receipt of welfare benefits to an individual's willingness to participate actively within a government sponsored employment or training scheme. These changes culminated in the Social Security Act (1989) which linked the receipt of welfare payments to an individual's active job search and willingness to accept any officially offered job after a maximum grace period of 13 weeks. While these changes are important in their own right, more interestingly, most trace their origins back to the American welfare-to-work system initiated by the Reagan administration during the early 1980s. This article will demonstrate why the Thatcher government turned to the United States in the development of their employment policy. Once an explanation for this has been provided the article will highlight the key policies transferred by the Thatcher Government in the development of the British welfare-to-work system. This entire analysis will be placed within a policy transfer framework in order to illustrate its usefulness in the analysis of policy development.},

The common thread missing from most of the globalization literature is the role of state agency in the regulation of the global political economy. This paper builds on a simple game-theoretic model of policy coordination to argue that great powers remain the most important actors in determining the extent of policy convergence. When great powers act in concert, there will be effective policy harmonization. When the great powers fail to agree, partial policy convergence will take place through competition. The increasing returns to scale of regulatory harmonization will lead powerful actors to compete for as many allies as possible, leading to strong policy convergence, but at multiple nodes. These different pathways are examined by inspecting the variation in outcomes of two different issue areas: money laundering and genetically modified organisms (GMOs).},

  abstract = {Over the past forty-five years, bilateral investment treaties (BITs)  have become the most important international legal mechanism for the  encouragement and governance of foreign direct investment. The  proliferation of BITs during the past two decades in particular has been  phenomenal. These intergovernmental treaties typically grant extensive  rights to foreign investors, including protection of contractual rights  and the right to international arbitration in the event of an investment  dispute. How can we explain the widespread adoption of BITs? We argue that  the spread of BITs is driven by international competition among potential  host countries\textemdash typically developing countries\textemdash for foreign  direct investment. We propose a set of hypotheses that derive from such an  explanation and develop a set of empirical tests that rely on network  measures of economic competition as well as more indirect evidence of  competitive pressures on the host to sign BITs. The evidence suggests that  potential hosts are more likely to sign BITs when their competitors have  done so. We find some evidence that coercion and learning play a role, but  less support for cultural explanations based on emulation. Our main  finding is that the diffusion of BITs is associated with competitive  economic pressures among developing countries to capture a share of  foreign investment. We are agnostic at this point about the benefits of  this competition for development.For useful  comments on earlier drafts of this article, we thank Bill Bernhard, Bear  Braumoeller, Frank Dobbin, Robert Franzese, Jeffry Frieden, Geoffrey  Garrett, Tom Ginsburg, Jude Hays, Lisa Martin, Bob Pahre, Mark Ramsayer,  Steven Ratner, Susan Rose-Ackerman, and John Sides.

  abstract = {Unlike the U.S. Constitution, many state constitutions include provisions for regulating and legislating specific policy issues. Embedding policy proscriptions in state constitutions may impact the rate and likelihood of policy diffusion. To examine how the amendment process influences diffusion resulting from geographic competition, we estimate a well-known policy diffusion model, using state-sponsored lotteries as a case study. Our mixed model of survival analysis separately estimates amendments and lottery adoptions allowing for different covariates and baseline hazards in each model. We find that there are different diffusion effects for constitutional amendments and policy adoptions, that the two-step process requires a more professionalized legislature, and that amending the state constitution influences the timing of the adoption process. Once we take into consideration the two-step process of lottery diffusion, we find a conditional diffusion effect that is over twice as large as previous estimates, and an overall diffusion that is larger than estimates from event-history estimation, suggesting that the constitutional hurdle is an important determinant of policy adoption. These effects occur over the entire policy adoption phase (1961\textendash 2009), over multiple specifications of the baseline hazard, for alternate measures of diffusion, and for alternate model specifications, thereby suggesting that the constitutional hurdle is an important element of state policy, and it should be empirically considered in future models of policy diffusion.},

Therefore, levels of ALM spending may well be too low, notwithstanding the mildly increasing coordination fostered through the EES framework. Stronger enforcement procedures may be necessary if the European Union is to achieve its EES objectives.},

Still, the unique role that interest groups play in policy diffusion networks is not fully understood, in large part because the current methodology for studying diffusion cannot parse out interest group influence. We address this problem by analyzing the actual text of legislation, moving away from binary adoption to a more nuanced measure of policy similarity. This allows us to distinguish whether states emulate other states or interest group model legislation. We use text similarity scores in a social network analysis to explore whether early-adopting states or interest groups are more central to the network. We apply this analytical framework to two policies\textemdash abortion insurance coverage restrictions and self-defense statutes. Based on this analysis, we find that a fundamentally different picture of policy diffusion networks begins to emerge\textemdash one where interest group model legislation plays a central role in the diffusion of innovations.},

Policy diffusion means that policies in one unit (country, state, city, etc.) are influenced by the policies of other units. The diffusion literature conceptualises these interdependencies with four mechanisms: learning, competition, coercion and emulation. The article identifies a model of diffusion that is dominant in the diffusion literature. According to this model, policies spread because decision makers evaluate the policy implications of the actions of other units. It is argued that the role of politics remains in the background in this model, and the article shows how going beyond a narrow focus on policy adoptions helps us to consider the politics of policy diffusion more explicitly.},

Hypotheses concerning the relationship between date of adoption and policy content and the effect of particular controversial policy provisions on reinventions are examined.

Absent from this research is a thorough discussion of the content of the information state governments use when deciding whether or not to adopt an innovative policy. Given the importance of information in decision making, we develop a model that focuses attention on one type of information, namely, the ideological position of previous adopters. Although not the only piece of relevant information, we believe that states look to the previous adopters in an effort to minimize the uncertainty about how issues fit in the liberalconservative policy space. We test this theory in three different policy areas, finding consistent evidence that ideological cues help states learn about policy innovations while replicating important findings from previous research.},

Results of testing hypotheses on 539 acquisitions that occurred in 1988-1993 show that all three imitation modes occur independently, but only highly salient outcomes sustain outcome imitation. Uncertainty enhances frequency imitation, but only some trait and outcome imitation. The results highlight the possible joint operation of social and technical indicators in imitation, illuminate factors that moderate vicarious learning processes, and show asymmetries between learning from success and failure.}

This manuscript focuses on differences in the patterns of reinvention for three different policy innovations with different rates of diffusion: child abuse reporting laws, crime victim compensation laws, and public campaign funding laws. Moreover, how the pattern changes after states amend their initial laws is examined. The data show evidence of reinvention during diffusion but provide only limited support for the first hypothesis that the pattern of reinvention is one of increasing comprehensiveness over time. Consistent with expectations, the data reveal little relationship between the date of adoption and the current law's comprehensiveness, including amendment.},

As a matter of fact, diffusion research has ended up in a diverse and often unconnected array of theoretical assumptions relying both on rational as well as constructivist reasoning \textendash{} a circumstance calling for more theoretical coherence and consistency. Against this backdrop, this paper reviews and streamlines diffusion literature in political science. Diffusion mechanisms largely cluster around two causal arguments determining the desires and preferences of actors for choosing alternative policies. First, existing diffusion mechanisms accounts can be grouped according to the rationality for policy adoption, this means that government behavior is based on the instrumental considerations of actors or on constructivist arguments like norms and rule-driven actors. Second, diffusion mechanisms can either directly impact on the beliefs of actors or they might influence the structural conditions for decision-making. Following this logic, four basic diffusion mechanisms can be identified in mechanism-based thinking on policy diffusion: emulation, socialization, learning, and externalities.},

Socialization\textemdash the process through which leaders in these secondary states embrace a set of normative ideals articulated by the hegemon\textemdash plays an important role both in establishing an international order and in facilitating the functioning of that order. This article develops the notion of socialization in the international system and examines three hypotheses about the conditions under which it occurs and can function effectively as a source of power. The first hypothesis is that socialization occurs primarily after wars and political crises, periods marked by international turmoil and restructuring as well as by the fragmentation of ruling coalitions and legitimacy crises at the domestic level. The second is that elite (as opposed to mass) receptivity to the norms articulated by the hegemon is essential to the socialization process. The third hypothesis is that when socialization does occur, it comes about primarily in the wake of the coercive exercise of power. Material inducement triggers the socialization process, but socialization nevertheless leads to outcomes that are not explicable simply in terms of the manipulation of material incentives. These hypotheses are explored in the historical case studies of U.S. diplomacy after World Wars I and II and the British colonial experience in India and Egypt.},

Alex Inkeles clarifies the meaning of convergence in the social organization of modern societies, shows how it can be measured, and illustrates in detail the manner and degree of convergence across national boundaries. Inkeles assesses the extent to which convergence in institutional patterns is reflected in the emergence of more common attitudes, values, and daily behaviors in different national populations as individuals and communities engage with and respond to the standardizing pressures of national development and global modernization. One popular image of the probable condition of humanity in the twenty-first century anticipates a new Armageddon with all the great civilizations at war with each other. This model neglects a less dramatic but deeper-seated process of worldwide change in which national economic and political systems become more alike and populations worldwide come to adopt similar lifestyles and develop similar attitudes and values for daily living. Alex Inkeles penetrating analysis focuses on this process of convergence.In One World Emerging? Inkeles clarifies the meaning of convergence in the social organization of modern societies, shows how it can be measured, and illustrates in detail the manner and degree of convergence across national boundaries. Sensitive to evidence counter to the main trend, he gives close attention to the many instances in which national differences persist and nations and their populations diverge from a common path.At the national level, he compares and contrasts the modernization of the United States, Russia, China, and India. Focusing on particularly important institutions, he reviews the process of convergence in prestige hierarchies, the family, education, and communications. Capping the enterprise, Inkeles assesses the extent to which convergence in institutional patterns is reflected in the emergence of more common attitudes, values, and daily behaviors in different national populations as individuals and communitiesin North America, Europe, and increasingly in Asiaengage with and respond to the standardizing pressures of national development and global modernization.},

I explain this success based on a sociological institutionalist framework, arguing that lifelong learning has become a global norm in education policy. For this purpose, I conduct a quantitative study of 99 countries from 1996 to 2004, showing how the idea of lifelong learning has been disseminated by international organisations and how states have reacted to this development. I first outline the theoretical framework, highlighting in particular the crucial role of international organisations. In a further step, I present the data and methods. In the third part, I analyse the activities of several international organisations on lifelong learning. In the fourth step, I show how lifelong learning has spread, distinguishing the idea of lifelong learning and reforms linked to it. Fifth, as the quantitative analysis shows, international organisations like the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union can explain a large part of dissemination when it comes to the idea of lifelong learning, but reforms are more dependent on national preconditions like the wealth of a country. In the conclusions, I sum up the article's main findings and outline further research areas linked to global diffusion processes.},

It uses event history analysis on pooled, cross-sectional data to examine the diffusion of three innovations in human services policy: individual development accounts, family caps, and medical savings accounts. Its results suggest that national intervention affects the likelihood that state lawmakers will adopt an innovation by altering the strength of the obstacles that prevent innovation or by providing resources to help overcome these obstacles. National intervention that does not affect these determinants of innovation seems to have no significant effect on state officials' decisions.},

First, he makes sense of the copious literature on policy diffusion and extends that literature in a very fruitful way. Second, he conducts the most thorough and methodologically sound empirical study of policy diffusion to date, using both qualitative and quantitative analysis. This book is so well written and thoughtful that it will likely stimulate a whole new wave of study of state policy and its diffusion." ---Chris Mooney, editor of State Politics and Policy Quarterly "Democratic Laboratories goes beyond standard 'diffusion of innovation' approaches to analyze the complex interaction of interstate and intrastate political forces that shapes policy change. The book is a major contribution to the study of American federalism---and a very good read." ---Kent Weaver, Brookings Institution "Andrew Karch has something new and important to say about the states as laboratories of democracies.

  abstract = {IntroductionAlthough policy learning may stem from assessments of policy failure (Ingold and Monaghan, 2016), establishing such a relationship is not straightforward. As is well known, the drivers of policy change and observations of policy change are not necessarily closely linked across time; indeed, the temporal link between cause and effect may be stretched over relatively long periods in patterns of change (McCashin, 2016). The chapter seeks to introduce a temporal perspective to catalogue the institutional constraints and opportunities embedded in sequences of repeated policy failure; and the subsequent ability of reform advocates to learn how to use the opportunities presented in future reform struggles.The first section of the chapter investigates the concept of policy failure in terms of several types, values and timings in order to assist understanding of how policy failures play out in longer sequences of policy making. The next section explores notions of policy learning in terms of the different types of failure identified. This leads into the main focus of the chapter: exploring connections between repeated assessments of policy failure, the catalysts of deinstitutionalisation and subsequent opportunities for system-wide policy learning and reform.Selected evidence from the reform trajectory of Australian health insurance policy from the mid-1970s to late-1990s is used to explore these possible relationships. The current Australian health insurance system has its origins in a tumultuous and foundational sequence of policy change between 1972 and 1984, which settled down in the subsequent 15 years or so to leave Australia with a distinctive but important health insurance model (for example, Colombo and Tapay, 2003; Hurley, 2002); an intriguing combination of universal public health insurance with financial and regulatory support for one of the highest percentages of private health insurance cover in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).The Australian health insurance case allows us to catalogue at least one pattern of the relationships between policy failure, deinstitutionalisation and learning. Three core analytical arguments underpin this pattern. First, policy failures create opportunities for learning at a system-wide level, following Elmore (1987), only after institutions have been eroded and exhausted by repeated failure. Second, this first claim holds in both the expert and political inquiry dimensions of policy failure.},

This deficit can be not only traced back to a lack of empirical findings, but is also the result of the heterogeneous and partially inconsistent theoretical literature on policy convergence. Although policy convergence constitutes a central concept in comparative public policy, it is not always consistently used and mixed up with related but not equivalent concepts. It is thus a basic objective of this paper to clarify the analytical relationship between policy convergence and related concepts used in the literature. Moreover, different approaches for the assessment and measurement of policy convergence will be presented. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of causes of policy convergence.},

First, it is driven by `soft' mechanisms of Europeanization such as policy transfer. The EU provides the framework for reform and functions as a platform of best practices. Policy transfer mechanisms are implemented in order for member states to pick and choose institutions. Second, domestic mediating factors such as policy preferences are as important as EU obligations. The introduction of the Ombudsman to Greece, Cyprus and Malta demonstrates that hard mechanisms of Europeanization (for example, directives) are not always necessary for change to occur. Soft mechanisms can be equally effective, as long as the political leadership prioritizes the reform. Third, policy change depends on time. Member states adjust their policies and institutions over time. The most common outcome of this adjustment is inertia or incremental change rather than convergence.},

We find that democratic dominoes do in fact fall as the theory contends. However, these dominoes fall significantly ``lighter'' than the importance of this model suggests. Countries ``catch'' only about 11\% of the increases or decreases in their average geographic neighbors' increases or decreases in democracy. This finding has potentially important foreign policy implications. The ``lightness'' with which democratic dominoes fall suggests that even if foreign military intervention aimed at promoting democracy in undemocratic countries succeeds in democratizing these nations, intervention is likely to have only a small effect on democracy in their broader regions.},

It does so by specifying the conditions and ways in which politics and learning interact and thus sustain cross-national and cross-sectoral variations in the spread of liberalisation. The process of liberalisation is analysed against data from 32 European and Latin American countries and two sectors. The indicators employed cover the issue of privatisation as well as regulatory reform. An analytical framework is presented that, for the first time, allows a systematic quantitative examination of the contrasting predictions of the Policy Sector Approach (PSA) and the National Patterns Approach (NPA). Four different combinations of variations and similarities across sectors and nations are identified and explained. These explanations are grounded in actor-centred historical institutionalism. The empirical evidence points to the failure of Latin America to become `European' despite the appearance of sweeping and comprehensive liberalisation. In addition, the article demonstrates how rational actors act in different institutional environments while accommodating the process of learning to their advantage, and how their actions are constrained by different historical legacies of state formation and varied levels of risks and rewards inherent in different sectors.},

We study bills from U.S. state legislatures. We present three ground truth tests, applied to a corpus of 500,000 bills. First, we show that bills introduced by ideologically similar sponsors exhibit a high degree of text reuse, that bills classified by the National Conference of State Legislatures as covering the same policies exhibit a high degree of text reuse, and that rates of text reuse between states correlate with policy diffusion network ties between states. In an empirical application of our similarity measure, we find that Republican state legislators introduce legislation that is more similar to legislation introduced by Republicans in other states, than is legislation introduced by Democratic state legislators to legislation introduced by Democrats in other states.},

The examination is conducted primarily via the application of three stochastic models (the Poisson, the "contagious Poisson," and the Gaussian [Markovian]) to 1946-1970 data on successful and unsuccessful military coups, aggregated at the world and selected regional levels. Since the statistical evidence indicates that the occurrence of earlier coups does affect the subsequent probability of coups elsewhere, the paper concludes with a speculative interpretation of the "coup contagion" phenomenon which emphasizes the possibility of behavioral reinforcement processes operating within global and regional communication networks.},

Scholars argue that the career paths of change agents could facilitate the diffusion of innovation through network-based mechanisms of portable innovation or policy wormholes, but have not fully distinguished between direct and indirect connections inherently important in a leadership transfer network. This study proposes an indirect portable innovation hypothesis and an indirect policy wormhole hypothesis to highlight the effects of leadership transfer networks through indirect network connections, extending the agent network diffusion (AND) model. We test the hypotheses empirically with the diffusion of local financial subsidy policies for new energy vehicles (NEVs) among cities in China from 2009 to 2016. The results confirm the effects of direct and indirect portable innovation and policy wormholes.},

By examining a rational learning model and the decisions of a set of developing countries to open up their trade regimes, I show that countries are particularly influenced by the choices of neighbouring countries and by particularly successful policy experiences. These are two typical contentions of the bounded learning literature. I argue that bounded learning and rational learning yield the same results as soon as one drops the rational learning assumption that there are zero costs to gathering new information.

By considering the actions of policy entrepreneurs--political actors who promote policy ideas--we can gain important insights into the process of policy innovation and innovation diffusion. Policy entrepreneurs constitute an identifiable class of political actors. Their presence and actions can significantly raise the probability of legislative consideration and approval of policy innovations. Event history analyses of the determinants of legislative consideration and approval of an idea for education reform--school choice--in the 48 contiguous United States from 1987 through 1992. The data set consists of unique information collected in a mail survey of members of the education policy elite in each state, augmented with published statistics. Policy entrepreneurs were identified as advocates of school choice in 26 states. While controlling for rival hypotheses, the presence and actions of policy entrepreneurs were found to raise significantly the probability of legislative consideration and approval of school choice as a policy innovation. These results suggest policy entrepreneurs should be given more attention in the literature on policy innovation diffusion.}

In this article, I consider more fully the potential impacts of social learning on policy diffusion, and develop a simple approach to modeling these impacts more flexibly.

We use social learning theory and demand, resource, and constraint analysis to explore this question. Contrary to Lowi's thesis that policy determines politics, there should be many similarities in the politics of these very dissimilar types of policy. An evaluation of three dimensions of abortion regulation reform from 1966 to 1972 (diffusion, reinvention, and determination) is used to test this hypothesis. Event history, hazard rate, and correlation analyses are applied to aggregate state data. A Guttman scale of abortion regulation permissiveness is developed. Our central conclusions are that even distinct policies (morality versus economically based policies) share similar politics, and the three dimensions of the adoption process can be influenced in different ways by the type of policy under consideration.}

'' Interviews with participants involved in formulating the federal Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities program offer evidence of limited policy learning from state enterprise zones. Respondents were aware of general trends and drew a few general conclusions, rather than borrowing from any particular state. None of the federal policymakers conducted an active search for information about the state zones, but state and federal organizations served as channels of information about the state programs. This finding suggests that such organizations assist state-federal diffusion as well as interstate diffusion of policy ideas.},

Leveraging data on successful and failed efforts across the U.S. states to adopt renewable portfolio standards (RPS), we show that the cue of ideological similarity matters more for RPS diffusion during adoption than cosponsorship. The result validates copious research that investigates external cues at adoption without considering that such cues might exert stronger influence earlier in lawmaking. Moreover, in devising a method to assess whether legislators are differentially receptive to cues from other states (here, we compared the baseline of adoption against cosponsorship), we provide scholars with a framework to further explore the question of whether external influence may be more pronounced among some legislators than others.},

An extensive set of studies assess PFP as largely unsuccessful in the federal government, and many of the private sector studies also found problems in PFP in the private sector. Yet, PFP continues to be adopted by governments in Europe, the United States and Australia. Our study examines the original adoption of PFP in 1978 to assess why it diffused so readily from the private sector to the federal government. We find PFP as a good example of Kingdon's (2002) garbage can decision making in which the policy champions presented PFP as a rational policy solution to widely perceived performance appraisal and reward problems at an opportune time. The PFP was trumpeted as an innovative policy but had almost no systematic evidence of success to support its use. Indeed, the problems of private sector PFP were diffused to the public sector. This case study underscores the lack of evidence-based decision making on an important presidential human management agenda, demonstrates an example of policy adoption based on myth rather than fact and concludes that better human resource management theories built on assumptions and public service motivation pertinent to the public sector are needed.},

The issue of the minimum people need in order to live decently is so difficult that Congress has left this crucial question to the states\textemdash even though the federal government foots three-fourths of the bill for about 15 million Americans who receive cash and food stamp benefits.The states differ widely in their assessment of what a family needs to meet a reasonable standard of living, and the interstate differences in welfare benefits cannot be explained by variations in wage levels or costs of living. The states with higher welfare benefits act as magnets by attracting or retaining poor people. In the competition to avoid becoming welfare havens, states have cut welfare benefits in real dollars by more than one-third since 1970. The authors propose the establishment of a minimum federal welfare standard, which would both reduce the interstate variation in welfare benefits and stem their overall decline.Peterson and Rom develop their argument in four steps. First they show how the politics of welfare magnets works in a case study of policymaking in Wisconsin. Second, they present their analysis of the overall magnet effect in American state politics, finding evidence that states with high welfare benefits experiencing disproportionate growth in their poverty rates make deeper welfare cuts. Third, they describe the process by which the current system came into being, identifying the reform efforts and political crises that have contributed to the centralization of welfare policy as well as the regional, partisan, and group interests that have resisted these changes. Finally, the authors propose a practical step that can go a long way toward achieving a national welfare standard; then assess it's cost, benefits, and political feasibility.},

Contrary to fears that global competition would produce a race to the bottom, there appears to be a race to the top, not only among rich countries but also among poor ones. Using econometric analysis of the adoption of automobile emission standards over the past twenty years for 129 countries, the author argues that this global diffusion results from countries' efforts to stay competitive in the international market. Due to the pressure from importing countries that have adopted stringent emission standards, even developing countries have rapidly moved to adopt rich country standards. The evidence shows that adoption of automobile emission standards correlates with an increase in the total value of automobile exports. Under some conditions, economic incentives in a global market can be a complement to environmental protection.},

In contrast, this article argues that policy transfer in tax blacklists has been a dysfunctional process tending to replicate errors. Rather than reflecting learning, normative mimicry, or market pressures, over-committed policymakers have responded to complexity and crisis by unreflectively cutting and pasting from foreign models. Facing a short-term political imperative to ``do something'' about tax evasion in an environment of fiscal crisis, many policy makers have compiled blacklists of tax havens by copying lists of ``the usual suspects'' from abroad. Evidence for both the process of transfer and the dysfunctional nature of resulting policy is provided by tracking recurring errors in these lists that are unlikely to have arisen independently.},

First, we distinguish among and find evidence for four mechanisms of policy diffusion: learning from earlier adopters, economic competition among proximate cities, imitation of larger cities, and coercion by state governments. Second, we find a temporal component to these effects, with imitation being a more short-lived diffusion process than the others. Third, we show that these mechanisms are conditional, with larger cities being better able to learn from others, less fearful of economic spillovers, and less likely to rely on imitation.},

  abstract = {Mothers' pensions were the first explicit welfare benefits established outside of poor relief in the United States. Contrary to established wisdom in political science, their enabling statutes spread very quickly across most states in the 1910s, with smaller, nonindustrial states often in the vanguard. Previous research concerning the predictors of state-level policy innovations has focused on a small subset of possible explanatory variables, typically economic or electoral conditions. We operationalize and test hypotheses about the influence of economic conditions, culture and ideology, electoral politics, governmental institutions and prior public policies, and the role of business, labor, and women's voluntary groups on the priority of state enactments. Our findings indicate that widespread federations of women's voluntary groups exerted a powerful influence on mothers' pension enactments even before most American women had the right to vote. We demonstrate the value to empirical political science of theories and variables referring to gender and women's politics.},

  abstract = {The Great Recession, Euro contagion, Middle East upheavals, nuclear proliferation, and expansion of rights, among others, highlight the centrality of diffusion to international studies. This Presidential Address outlines building blocks for a shared conceptualization of diffusion that is attentive to the initial stimulus; the medium through which information about the stimuli may/may not travel to other destinations; the political agents un/affected by the stimulus' positive or negative externalities, who aid or block the stimulus' journey to other destinations; and outcomes that enable discrimination among grades of diffusion and resulting equilibria. Various issue areas illustrate how initial stimuli may/may not change preferences, transform identities, trigger emotions, alter strategic choices, and affect outcomes. I advance three related considerations. First, to avoid selection bias, understanding what does not diffuse (the ``Vegas counterfactual'') should be as central as what does. Concepts such as firewalls and sedimentation are essential for gauging a medium's relative immunity/vulnerability to diffusion. Second, weaving domestic, regional, and global considerations into a single analytical framework reduces omitted variable bias and enables systematic cross-regional comparisons. Third, these building blocks imbue the study of diffusion with political dynamics\textemdash entailing strategic interaction, contingency, incomplete information, and unintended effects\textemdash that defy determinism, automaticity, or teleology. Similar causal mechanisms may yield different outcomes under different domestic, regional, and global conditions. And different mechanisms may yield similar outcomes under comparable circumstances. I highlight the challenges inherent in assessing the outcomes of diffusion given competing empirical findings, epistemologies, and normative readings of what does/does not and should/should not diffuse, and outline an agenda for future research.},

More specifically, how can qualitative methods address the ``twin challenge of interdependence,'' namely the challenge to identify diffusion, on the one hand, and the challenge to discriminate between mechanisms of diffusion, on the other? I argue, first, that there are three distinct qualitative techniques that can be used, namely cross-case analysis (often based on systematic case selection), within-case process tracing, and counterfactual reasoning. I demonstrate how these techniques can be adapted to the study of policy diffusion. Second, a combination of these methods is the best practice, since they are largely complementary in terms of the twin challenge of diffusion. The discussion draws on numerous illustrations from recent qualitative policy diffusion studies. The article closes with some suggestions for further methodological development in the study of policy diffusion, including the combination of quantitative and qualitative methods.},

The analyses address the existence or absence of diffusion effects in regard to changes in the degree of freedom in the world's governments, and whether or not there has been a more specific global movement towards democracy. The dependent variable is the set of ``governmental transitions,'' based on yearly Freedom House data. Diffusion analyses are at the global, regional, and neighbor-state levels (1974-1987). Thus analysis is limited to cues or prototypes from the external environment of states. Although neighbor effects are less than those found with the diffusion of war, all three levels support the proposition that there has been a diffusion of governmental transitions, including a movement towards democracy that provided a context for the dramatic events of 1988 and 1989.},

This article proposes methods for incorporating a priori notions about social structure into analysis. Diffusion is modeled within an event history framework where the individual's rate of adoption is a function of prior adoptions by related actors. Two diffusion models are suggested: an epidemic model where adoption rates vary with the number of prior adoptions, and a salience model where adoption rates vary with time since the last event. This approach is illustrated in an examination of the decolonization of British and French colonies. Diffusion is shown to occur within regions rather than within empires or the world system as a whole.},

Yet little is known about whether governments abandon policies that have failed elsewhere, as would be consistent with states acting as policy laboratories not only for policy successes but also for failures. This article focuses on the possible abandonment of failing welfare-to-work policies in the formative years (1997\textendash 2002) of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program across the 50 U.S. states. Using a dyad-based event history analysis, I find that, if both states in a pairing have a policy and one state's policy fails (in employing welfare recipients, reducing welfare rolls, or reducing overall poverty rates), then the other state is much more likely to abandon that failing policy. Moreover, such learning from the other state's experience is more common when the states are ideologically similar to one another and when the legislature in the potentially learning state is more professional.},

  abstract = {We are now in the midst of a notable revival of interest in the politics of the American states. During the last decade many studies have been conducted of the social, political and economic determinants of state policy outcomes. Several of these writers have argued that the relative wealth of a state, its degree of industrialization, and other measures of social and economic development are more important in explaining its level of expenditures than such political factors as the form of legislative apportionment, the amount of party competition, or the degree of voter participation. It has been claimed that such factors as the level of personal income or the size of the urban population are responsible both for the degree of participation and party competition in a state, and the nature of the system's policy outputs. By making this argument these writers have called into question the concepts of representation and theories of party and group conflict which, in one form or another, are the foundations for much of American political science.There is a growing awareness, however, that levels of expenditure alone are not an adequate measure of public policy outcomes. Sharkansky has shown, for example, that levels of expenditure and levels of actual service are seldom correlated; presumably, some states are able to reach given service levels with much less expenditure than others. Besides establishing the appropriate level of expenditure for a program, policy makers must also decide about the program's relative scope, provisions for appeal from administrative orders, eligibility requirements, the composition of regulatory boards and commissions, and many other matters which have little to do with money.},

Speed of policy diffusion also appears to be related to the time of the policy "invention," although methodological considerations precluded a more systematic analysis of this factor.}

Focusing on the spread of Chilean-style pension privatization in Latin America, this article assesses the relative merit of four theoretical explanations that scholars of diffusion have proposed. As the principal mechanism driving innovations' spread, these approaches emphasize external pressures, emanating especially from international financial institutions; the quest for symbolic or normative legitimacy; rational learning and cost-benefit calculation; and cognitive heuristics, respectively. The article assesses which one of these frameworks can best account for the three distinctive features of diffusion, namely its wavelike temporal pattern; its geographical clustering; and the spread of similarity amid diversity. While several approaches contribute to understanding policy diffusion, the analysis suggests that the cognitive-psychological framework offers a particularly persuasive account of the spread of pension reform.},

  abstract = {Why do very different countries often emulate the same policy model? Two years after Ronald Reagan's income-tax simplification of 1986, Brazil adopted a similar reform even though it threatened to exacerbate income disparity and jeopardize state revenues. And Chile's pension privatization of the early 1980s has spread throughout Latin America and beyond even though many poor countries that have privatized their social security systems, including Bolivia and El Salvador, lack some of the preconditions necessary to do so successfully. In a major step beyond conventional rational-choice accounts of policy decision-making, this book demonstrates that bounded--not full--rationality drives the spread of innovations across countries. When seeking solutions to domestic problems, decision-makers often consider foreign models, sometimes promoted by development institutions like the World Bank. But, as Kurt Weyland argues, policymakers apply inferential shortcuts at the risk of distortions and biases. Through an in-depth analysis of pension and health reform in Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Peru, Weyland demonstrates that decision-makers are captivated by neat, bold, cognitively available models. And rather than thoroughly assessing the costs and benefits of external models, they draw excessively firm conclusions from limited data and overextrapolate from spurts of success or failure. Indications of initial success can thus trigger an upsurge of policy diffusion.},

The application of SNA in public policy studies, including research methods, analytic tools, and basic concepts of network analysis, were systematically reviewed. UCINET software was used to visualize the knowledge network of research topics. The main research topics were classified into five categories: agenda setting, policy network, advocacy coalition, policy learning and diffusion, policy implementation. Finally, this article suggests that network analysis in public administration should be thoroughly re-examined; in particular, scholars should consider the benefits of SNA for public policy research. In the application of SNA to public policy research, it is necessary to broaden the study perspective and scope, further strengthen interdisciplinary theoretical interaction and theoretical innovation, and take advantage of big data and other new technological tools that can develop giant network analysis for public policy.},

  abstract = {不断推动地方政策创新并将成功经验推广是改革开放以来我国政策制定的显著特征。既有研究较好地解释了地方政府为什么要及为什么可能创新,但关注创新理念产生、被政策参与者接受并最终成为政策实践的过程研究相对较少。本文以南国市医保政策创新为例,运用政策企业家理论分析了中国地方政府的政策创新过程,尤其关注创新过程中的关键主体及其互动。研究发现,为提升组织地位,争取更多的行政资源,行政官僚在创新过程中扮演了政策企业家角色。凭借知识和技术专长,他们不仅构建政策议题、提出创新理念、设计政策方案,还通过营销、结盟、制造政绩等策略来获得其他政策参与者尤其是地方领导人的认可和支持,从而推动政策创新的形成和持续发展。},
